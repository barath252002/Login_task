# Login_task
In this page, a user can register their details to store their database and can login to the page. Once registered using an id, registering is not necessary, hence enjoy feasible access to the website. The page uses Jquery Ajax which connects to backend. The login session is remembered using "localstorage". Enjoy using the project !!
